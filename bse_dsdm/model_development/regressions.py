Sparsity:

Ridge regression does not lead to sparsity in the coefficient estimates.
Lasso regression often results in sparse models with some coefficients exactly equal to zero.
Use Cases:

Ridge regression is useful when dealing with multicollinearity and you want to shrink coefficients without necessarily excluding features.
Lasso regression is suitable for situations where feature selection is desired, and some features can be entirely disregarded.
Solution Stability:

Ridge regression tends to be more stable when the dataset has highly correlated features.
Lasso regression may be less stable, and the inclusion or exclusion of a single feature can sometimes lead to significant changes in the model.
